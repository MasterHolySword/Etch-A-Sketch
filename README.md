# Etch-A-Sketch
A simple web-based etch-a-sketch program. It has rgb colors, eraser functions, and resizing.

I made it with pure vanilla javascript.

I learned how to better utilize event handlers, how to take user input, more DOM manipulation, hover functions in css, and also had practice with Math.random functions.

Some problems I ran into was trying to figure out how to make the board remain in a certain space when resizing it. I figured out that my border width was adding up which made it so the more boxes I added the larger my board became.

Also arrow functions are still confusing at times.
